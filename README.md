# responsive-video-background-tutorial

This responsive video background is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ITxSzjZUc&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8mpXIUHjWoMAAgoCEinL0R&index=7&t=0s) from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw). It is a video background that stays the same no matter what the size.

My rendering of this tutorial is [published on Git Hub](https://martucazpo.github.io/responsive-video-background-tutorial/). Rather than include a photo, in which it is hard to appreciate how the video resizes, click on the link to try it out!
